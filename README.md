# github-notes

It is a sandbox for tesing git-hub commands 
and some notes to quickly find and use the right
command. Here I use only **CLI** to use git.

## Working with stash

### commit with add
```shell
  git commit -am "message"
```

### stash
```shell
git stash [--include-untracked]
```

### get from stash 

```shell
  git stash pop
```
